                                <p class = "section3_text">Last summer, I worked on earthquake signal processing and detection at Stanford Geophysics, where I used Python (ObsPy, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and cv2) to build a data pipeline to process (denoise) the data and subsequently detect extremely small earthquakes in the data that are difficult to find even with human expertise. The data was noisy and I used signal processing techniques such as filtering in order to remove unwanted noise but preserve useful signal. Then, by first converting the signal into frequency domain images, I was able to apply computer vision to detect and amplify edges in the signal which signified earthquakes. I then used machine learning (K-means clustering) to cluster patches of the signal into "earthquake" and "non-earthquake" signal, which allowed me to use the clusters to identify earthquake picks for new data.</p>

Then, I created a chatbot AI using a decision tree and a knowledge base of vocabulary words which would respond to user messages. For a more dynamic experience, in the newer versions, the chatbot has simulated emotions which influence its messages. In one version, the emotions are modeled using a Markov chain. In the newest version, the simulation was modeled using a subset of the PAD model in psychology. Probability was utilized to simulate small changes in emotion, as well as some influence from the user's messages. Future versions would include a more dynamic version of emotion simulation which would place more weight on the influence of the user's sentiment.</p>
