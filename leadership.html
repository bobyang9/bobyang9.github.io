I enjoy coming up with unique icebreakers and start interesting conversations that will bring humor to the meeting.</p>

Our team held workshops on design thinking, public speaking, time management, and other soft skills that are crucial for good leadership. Joining and then leading APASL was what exposed me to Team HBV, since APASL is a Team HBV branch. Club members participated in Team HBV activities such as youth conferences and  volunteer opportunities. </p>
